# PassXYZ Open Source Projects

Welcome to the PassXYZ open source project family! This repository contains a series of secure password management applications developed across different technology stacks. As technology has evolved, so has the PassXYZ series, transitioning from Xamarin to the modern .NET MAUI framework.

Below is an overview of the three main projects in the PassXYZ series:

---

## 1. PassXYZ – Xamarin/Xamarin.Forms

The original **PassXYZ** application, built using **Xamarin/Xamarin.Forms**, was the first iteration of our secure password manager. It provided a cross-platform solution for managing sensitive data on iOS, Android, and Windows devices.

- **Technology Stack**: Xamarin/Xamarin.Forms
- **Status**: Legacy / No longer actively developed
- **Note**: This version served as the foundation for future iterations and is preserved for historical and reference purposes.

## 2. PassXYZ.Vault – Xamarin/Xamarin.Forms

**PassXYZ.Vault** was the successor to the original PassXYZ app, also built on **Xamarin/Xamarin.Forms**. It introduced enhanced security features, improved UI/UX, and better integration with the PassXYZ backend services.

- **Technology Stack**: Xamarin/Xamarin.Forms
- **Support Status**: ❌ **Support Ended May 1, 2024**
